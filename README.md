# Vault

I was tired of storing all my passwords in my internet browser, so I decided to create my very own password manager. The aim is to have every single password stored in a USB stick, with all the data encrypted as FUCK !
So this is how I decided to create Vault. Also I wanted to learn rust so why not do it in this language.

# How does it work ?

I still don't know how I'm gonna do it

# Installation

I don't know clone the repo (work in progress)
